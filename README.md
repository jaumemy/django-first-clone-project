# About this project

This is a very basic blog, where as a logged in user, you can crate posts, manage drafts, approve or reject comments, delete post or comments.      
If you are a visitor, you can view posts, view comments, and add a comment wich should be accepted by a user before being shown      
It's called music blog just because I wanted to add some changing color features, that's it

# django-first-clone-project
This is my first guided Django web project, uploaded on Github.    
I will try to host it on pythonanywhere.

# Updated on Sat, Nov 28:

Took me some time, but dortunately, less work than expected debugging, personalizing  and deploying it on the web.

Here is the final result. Hope you like it!
