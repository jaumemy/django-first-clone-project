# django-first-clone-project
This is my first guided Django web project, uploaded on Github.    
I will try to host it on pythonanywhere.

It's called music blog just because I wanted to add some changing color features, that's it

#Updated on Sat, Nov 28:

Took me some time, but dortunately, less work than expected debugging, personalizing  and deploying it on the web.

Here is the final result. Hope you like it!
